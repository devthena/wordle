# React Wordle

This is the game of Wordle created in React.

Since there is no authentication implemented, all the stats are saved in `localStorage` with a fixed key.

## How to Play

- Guess the Wordle in six (6) tries
- Each guess must be a valid five-letter English word
- `GREEN` colored tile is for a letter in the correct spot
- `YELLOW` colored tile is for a letter in the wrong spot
- `GREY` colored tile is for a letter that do not exist
