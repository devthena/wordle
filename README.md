# Parthenon Wordle

This is an app that lets users login to play a game of Wordle.

It has two modes: Solo and Co-op.

For solo mode, this is the same as playing the official Wordle game. For co-op, the user will be able to create a room and invite a second person to play the game with them or against them.

## How to Play

- Guess the Wordle in six (6) tries
- Each guess must be a valid five-letter word
- The color of the tiles will change based on how close your guess was to the word

## Co-op with Friends

In the main menu, you can either create a room or join one in order to play with friends. There is a maximum of two people per room, and the host can choose if they will play together as allies or against each other as opponents.

### Hosting a Room

Users can create rooms and adjust some settings for the game. After creating the room, the user will be given a `Room Code` that they can share with a friend. Once the friend joins and the game starts, the settings cannot be changed until the game is over.

### Joining a Room

The `Room Code` is a five-letter code that will be provided to the host of a room. Once the user enters this code and agrees to join, the game will start. When one person closes the browser or clicks on the Leave button while the game is ongoing, the other person would be notified and the game will end.
